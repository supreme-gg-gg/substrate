# Substrate Benchmarking

This is the nascent suite for benchmarking Substrate's performance at scale.

## Deploy benchmarks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Source the environment configuration file (e.g., `source .ate-dev-env.sh`)
> first so `PROJECT_ID`, `BUCKET_NAME`, etc. are set.

Note that deploying the benchmarks does not run them. You must visit Locust's
web UI to start a test.

A single wrapper deploys the scale workloads, builds and pushes the Locust
image, then deploys the Locust workers:

```bash
./benchmarking/deploy_locust.sh --deploy
```

Useful flags:

* `--worker-count N` — number of `WorkerPool` replicas (default 1).
* `--skip-build` — reuse the existing `:latest` locust image (skip the
  `docker build && docker push` step).

To tear everything down (locust then workloads, in reverse order):

```bash
./benchmarking/deploy_locust.sh --delete
```

The same operations are also reachable from the top-level installer for
convenience:

```bash
./hack/install-ate.sh --deploy-benchmarks
./hack/install-ate.sh --delete-benchmarks
```

The installer accepts `--benchmark-worker-count N` (default `1`).
`--skip-build` is only available when invoking
`benchmarking/deploy_locust.sh` directly.

## Running Tests

### Locust Web UI
* Run `kubectl port-forward svc/locust -n benchmarking 8089:8089`
* Visit `http://localhost:8089` in your browser to configure and start the load test.

The different user classes you can select are different types of load behaviors
you can throw at the system. Note that the "CounterUser" load type requires
that the counter demo be installed.

You can also configure things like the number of users, how quickly those users
are spawned, the frequency with which requests are made and whether or not tracing is
enabled.

### Viewing Traces
You must have enabled otel tracing for your cluster to view traces.

You can find trace IDs by viewing the `logs` tab in the Locust UI

## Optional: Prometheus + Grafana

Locust provides graphs, statistics, etc. via the UI. However, you
can install Prometheus/Grafana if you want richer details or
the ability to perform deeper analysis. Skip this section if
you're only using the Locust web UI.

```bash
kubectl apply -f benchmarking/monitoring.yaml
```

Once installed:

* Run `kubectl port-forward svc/grafana -n benchmarking 3000:3000`
* Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Development

### Rebuilding gRPC Python clients

Make sure you have a virtual environment created (`python3 -m venv venv`)
and activated (`source venv/bin/activate`).

Install project requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then run `generate_protos.sh` to generate the Python proto clients.
